# Kenny Koala's Bushfire Survival Plan

By Garry Francis

## Background

The weather is getting hotter and bushfire season is approaching. The animals have to stock up on food and prepare their bushfire survival plans.

Every year, the animals appoint a bushfire warden. The bushfire warden has an important job to do, for he or she has to check on all the other animals and make sure that they have their bushfire survival plans in place.

This year, it's Kenny Koala's turn to be the bushfire warden. He has a checklist of things to do. Can you help Kenny to complete all the things on his checklist?
