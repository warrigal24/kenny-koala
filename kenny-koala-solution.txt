Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Scores are shown in parentheses as +A=B, where A is points earned and B is cumulative points earned. Optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. You can omit these once you know what to do.
